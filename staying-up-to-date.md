# Staying up to date
Just a few of my personal reflections

The main things is that you follow the motto of ShopTalk Show: **Just Build WebSites**

You need to code every day. And when you feel uninspired, or have limited time, re-code something you've already done once. That'll make it even faster the next time.

So here's what I do, I think it's important that each of you find your own path. Mine is JS heavy, you might wish to look more into CSS.

## Podcasts
I love podcasts.
 - I get to hear the thoughts of awesome developers
 - It's light, I can do it while doing the dishes, or commuting to work
 - They bring up new topics: I might not get it, but then I've heard it once, and all of a sudden it's part of my vocabulary. Then when I've heard about it enough times, then I have a running start when it's time to learn the new technology.
 - It's great to hear some of the best developers in the world struggling to understand stuff like React :-)

 Here's my favourites right now
 1. ShopTalk Show
 Hosted by Criss Coyer & Dave Rupert. Very lightweight and casual. They bring up listener questions adn have years of experience
 2. ToolsDay
 Hosted by Una Kravets & CHris Dhanaraj. Still lightweight, but the focus os more, well, focused. They discuss tools and have this funny little thing where they challenge each other to build new stuff in a new technology.
 3. JavaScript Jabber
 A bit hard, and some of the episode I skip entirely
4. The Web Platform Podcast
5. Front End Happy Hour
6. modern-web.org
7. The Laracasts Snippet
Hosted by Jeffrey Way
I love this one, it's 15 minutes or so and not very related to web. It's mostly thoughts about life in tech, staying ahead of the game, family and stuff.

## Twitter
Twitter is awesome. It's short, and with a curated list of people to follow, it can be a great way of seeing what the front end of the front enders are talking about.
